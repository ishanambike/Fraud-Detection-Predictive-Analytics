# Fraud-Detection-Predictive-Analytics
This problem involves predicting whether a transaction is a fraud based on data available about the transaction and the customer. The data was made available by Kaggle in the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection competition hosted in 2019. The data for this problem was collected from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) and Vesta Corporation. The aim of this problem is to predict fraud transactions correctly and also minimize false positives. To solve this problem I built and analyzed various Machine Learning models and found which model predicts fraudulent transactions most accurately.
